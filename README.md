## How to use this template

To use this, either create a new ionic project using the ionic node.js utility, or copy and paste this into an existing Cordova project and download a release of Ionic separately.

### With the Ionic tool:

```bash

$ ionic platform add ios
$ ionic ionic serve
$ ionic build ios
$ ionic emulate ios

```

Substitute ios for android if not on a Mac, but if you can, the ios development toolchain is a lot easier to work with until you need to do anything custom to Android.
